        <p><em>The Scenario</em></p>
        <p>In preparation for the 2026 midterm elections, a watchdog organization is tracking how often social media posts viewed by users contain misleading political information. A major platform claims only <m>{{p0dec}}\%</m> of political posts shared by users contain false or misleading content.</p>
        <p>The watchdog group takes a random sample of <m>{{s}}</m> political post and finds <m>{{x}}</m> flagged by independent fact-checkers as misleading or false.</p>

        <intro><p><em>Part A</em></p>
        <p> Compute the confidence interval for the sample at a <m>{{CL}}\%</m> confidence level and provide all your computations. You may use an app to do the computations. Provide a screenshot of any app you use and all computation you do. Use your confidence interval to answer the follow:</p>

         <p><em>Part B</em></p>
           <p> The watchdog group argues that the percentage of political posts shared with false or misleading content is NOT <m>{{p0dec}}\%</m>. Do a hypothesis test using the same sample and confidence level from Part A. You may use an app to do the test. If you do so, you must insert a screenshot of your work and also specifically identify the following:</p>
