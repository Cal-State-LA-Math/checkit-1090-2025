    <p><em>Scenario:</em></p>
    <p>
        In July 2025, a coalition of local governments surveyed 1,300 urban residents in {{state_1}}, {{state_2}} and {{state_3}} about home readiness for extreme heat.The survey was conducted in English and {{language}}.</p>
    <p>
        Survey respondents were asked to what degree they agreed with the following statements, using a 5-point scale: “Strongly Agree,” “Agree,” “Neutral,” “Disagree,” or “Strongly Disagree.”</p>
    
        <list>
            <item><p>Because the negligent and incompetent government has repeatedly failed to take meaningful action on the worsening climate crisis, I’ve been forced to spend my own hard-earned money to prepare my home for the increasingly deadly and unrelenting heat.</p></item>
            <item><p>My corrupt and indifferent city government blatantly ignores vulnerable, low-income communities and refuses to provide adequate protections against the escalating threat of extreme heat.</p></item>
        </list>
    <p>
        <m>{{result_1}}\%</m> survey respondents said that they {{agree_1}} with the statement "Because the negligent and incompetent government has repeatedly failed to take meaningful action on the worsening climate crisis, I’ve been forced to spend my own hard-earned money to prepare my home for the increasingly deadly and unrelenting heat." <m>{{result_2}}\%</m> said that they {{agree_2}} with the statement "My corrupt and indifferent city government blatantly ignores vulnerable, low-income communities and refuses to provide adequate protections against the escalating threat of extreme heat".</p>

        <content><p>Does the above use a sampling frame? If so, what is the sampling frame?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>Yes, there is a sampling frame in this scenario. The frame are urban residents in {{state_1}}, {{state_2}} and {{state_3}}</p></outtro>

        <content><p>What is the sampling method used in the above scenario?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>The sampling method was a SRS, explanation needed</p></outtro>

    <knowl>
        <content><p>Looking at the sampling frame and the sampling method, would the sample be a valid sample or is it likely to be a biased sample? Explain why.</p></content>
        <outtro><p>The sampling method is valid. The sampling frame is NOT valid so the sample is bias. Student's need to explain why the sampling frame is bias</p></outtro>
    </knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>Identify potential sources of bias other than the sampling method and sampling frame from the information given and explain why they lead to bias (Only use the information given, do not speculate about information not provided).</p></content>
        <outtro><p>Only limited language choices; the wording of the statements; timing of the survey. Explanations needed.</p></outtro></knowl>
    <knowl>
        <content><p>If they did the survey again, would you expect that exactly <m>{{result_1}}\%</m> of respondents would {{agree_2}} with the statement "Overreaching states should not have the unchecked authority to impose extreme bans on widely used and medically approved abortion drugs under the guise of protecting life."? Why or why not?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>No, the exact same result would not be expected due to sampling variability, explanation needed</p></outtro>

        <content><p>Based on the results of this survey, can the national education nonprofit be sure they have a good idea of how college faculty members feel about the role of AI in the classroom? Why or why not?</p></content>
        <outtro><p>No, too much bias, explanation needed. </p></outtro></knowl>
