        <em>The Scenario</em>
          <p>In 2025, climate change continues to dominate headlines. A Pew Research Center survey asked U.S. adults whether they support a federal policy to ban the construction of new fossil fuel power plants in favor of renewable energy sources. A total of {{s}} adults responded to the survey. Of those, {{x}} adults supported the policy.</p>
