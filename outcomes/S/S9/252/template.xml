        <em>The Scenario</em>
          <p>As AI tools like ChatGPT become more common in education, a national survey asked U.S. adults whether they support teaching students how to use AI responsibly as part of high school curriculum.  A total of {{s}} adults responded to the survey. Of those, {{x}} adults agreed with incorpating AI literacy into high schools.</p>
        <p> Compute a <m>{{CL}}\%</m> confidence interval for the proportion of {{prose}}. You may use an app to do the computations. You must show all your computations and/or a screenshot of any app used. Please use your work answer the following.</p>
